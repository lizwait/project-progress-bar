# project-progress-bar
Progress bar updated using Github Projects API

Special thanks to mr_chicken_5 for helping out these Windows newbs! <3

## The Plan, Stan
- Widget for stream to show project progress
- What will we use for project tracking
- Github Projects
- Number of items done / number of items total

## Requirements
As twitch streamers, 
We want to display a progress bar on stream,
So that viewers can be up-to-date on our current project progress

## Sprint Zero
1. Set up tools
    - IDE
    - Repo
    - Install NPM
    - Install the progressbar.js
    - Make tickets
    - Push initial commit

2. Create the progress bar front end
3. Hook up the progress bar to a specific GitHub project
4. Generalize the above
5. Publish for use in the widget
6. Make the widget in OBS
7. TEST

UI

Next Stream TO-DOs before:
1. Get my damn SSH
2. Push up recent changes
3. Decide on API client
4. Figure out TDD - Jest
5. Github API for "get" tasks from projects
6. Make tickets

NEXT STREAM PLAN --
TDD the backend "getTasks" from GitHub Projects
New style of screen sharing --
    - Bonnie hosts LiveShare
    - Liz shares whole screen on Discord / OBS other stuff
New layout with ticket "view"
