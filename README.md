# project-progress-bar
Progress bar updated using Github Projects API

Special thanks to mr_chicken_5 for helping out these Windows newbs! <3

## The Plan, Stan
- Widget for stream to show project progress
- What will we use for project tracking
- Github Projects
- Number of items done / number of items total

## Requirements
As twitch streamers,
We want to display a progress bar on stream,
So that viewers can be up-to-date on our current project progress

UI
https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/progressbar.js/blob/gh-pages/examples/password-strength/main.js

### Next Stream TO-DOs
Main Goal -- Grabbing information we need from GitHub Projects
-- Grab the number of tickets from the GitHub projects
-- Grab information about the ticket statuses
-- Win! No matter what! Put Your hands in the air.
And they stay there

NOTE: We need to use ProjectV2

### Between Streams
-- What do GraphQL
-- Finish some sort of creative stuff
-- Get more familiar with GraphQL
